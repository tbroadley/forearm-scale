## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up the RethinkDB database and configure the connection details in `src/server/rethinkdb.ts`.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.

## Server

The server is implemented in the `src/server` directory. It uses the Express framework and connects to the RethinkDB database.

## RethinkDB

The RethinkDB client is encapsulated in the `src/server/rethinkdb.ts` file. It provides methods to establish a connection, execute queries, and close the connection.

## App

The main application file is `src/app.ts`. It creates an instance of the Express app, sets up middleware, and starts the server.

## Types

The `src/types/index.ts` file exports interfaces and types used in the project.
